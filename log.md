# 1483558021 20170104 11:27 Day 1
** Today: Finished Object Oriented and Functional Programming (2 hours)
   in about 20 min. while in a conference call at work

   Moving on to Basic Algorithm Scripting (50 hours)!

** Finished 6 of 17 of those.

   Suggestions to the FCC development team:
    * Add optional audio recitation to (almost) every page
    * Add orientation explaining TDD (test-driven development) and how it relates to the FCC service
    * Move jQuery to be after JavaScript
    ** Add orientation emphasizing that jQuery is JavaScript 
    *** note that $ is just a variable name ... the entry point for jQuery
    *** note that _ is a similar example for "underscore" and "lodash"
    * Add info about and orientation for ES6 (ES2016?)
    * Add SQL/SQLite Section!!!!
    * Start adding test-driven development (TDD)
