** Yesterday: finished review of FCC stuff
   Finished FCC HTML5 and CSS (5 hours), Responsive Design with Bootstrap (5 hours),
 Gear up for Success (20 minutes), jQuery (3 hours), Basic Front End Development Projects (50 hours)
** Today: finished Basic JavaScript (10 hours)

* Thoughts: I also posted links to my old Pythy (JS animation) and "Nine Dots" (SVG) pages and a question
  regarding how to clean up the latter.
